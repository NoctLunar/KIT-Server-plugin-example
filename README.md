# KIT-Server-plugin-example
For right now this is just a basic example on how you can make your own module for our server, for your applications use case. Currently this is limited to who can make plugins since there are clearly security risk involved with this. Which i will work on when i have the time so more developers can create plugins that run for there applications only


But yes there are already simple checks put in place to prevent backdooring, data stealing ect. If any are caught trying there developer role,perms and subscrioption application will be remove from our netowrk and servers

Have a good day!

This will be updated in the future.
